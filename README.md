# Alexa flight scanner

## What is it? 
Our project is about building a skill for Alexa, which enables it to process user's queries regarding flights on certain days, with certain prices, to certain destinations etc. The query results are read out to the user and also stored on a web application for the purpose of further browsing for the user.
A user will be able to simply ask alexa to provide details of flights with a variety of parameters (Location, time, dates, etc).

## How did it come to be?
The idea evolved as a project for a software engineering class.
