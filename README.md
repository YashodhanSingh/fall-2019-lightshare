## What is it? 
LightShare is lightweight, plug and play solution for individuals or groups looking start their own content writing platform. At it's core, LightShare is a blogging tool that can be simply downloaded, configured and deployed without having to worry about garbage overhead and scaling. 

As a platform, LightShare allows an Admin to setup and configure how the platform should be. The pubication, in whatever form it may be, consists of a series of "Issues". Each issue has a new set of articles. Admins can grant access to editors/authors who will then be able to use the admin panel to actually write the articles in Markdown syntax. Once all articles are written, the Admin can publish the issue, and now it is available for the world to read. LightShare will also contain a team management tool and a team page - so that admins can periodically change the current team and transfer ownership of the publication. 

We see the project being very useful for small publications that need a quick and easy solution to deploy their own website and share content on it.
